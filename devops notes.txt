2. groups

groupadd name			
            every user will have primary and secondary groups
            you want to two groups at the same time

-g --> primary group
-aG --> secindary group

3. change the ownership
chown --> even file owner also can't run this command only sudo 
          sudo user can change the ownership

                              the ownership  to the file

tomcat,jboss,java,.net,python

Linux file system servers
--------------------------
/ -->root folder for linux server 
boot -->when the server is getting started, server refers this directory 
      and configuration from --> grub.cfg
dev --> devices --> external devices are mounted here 
etc --> extra configuration 
home --> users home directories are created here 
lib/lib64 --> system needs liabraries
/media --> cd/dvd drive
/mnt --> extra disks mount here
/opt --> optional,mannual instalation of services or applications will be
         downloaded here
/proc --> running process will be store here with their PID
/proc /cpuinfo
/proc /meminfo
/root --> root user home folder
/run --> when server starts,server uses as this directory as storage 
/bin --> cat,vim,touch,cd/dvd
/sbin --> system commands like root access commands
/temp --> temp files not important
